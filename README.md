# ENGR 102 Practice Submission

This is to help you learn how to use Gradescope. First, create a file named `practice_submission.py` that includes **only** the code

```python
print("Howdy, World?")
```

and submit. You will fail both tests. But that's okay! This is for learning!

Look at the tests - there are two of them. The one titled "Compare output" checks the output of your code. Can you figure out what's wrong?

Look at the second test titled "Comment". This one doesn't give you much information. It says to include a # style comment. So, add a comment to your file and resubmit.

You can submit your assignments as many times as you want - [there is no penalty for multiple submissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQtcWPjgwGc). If you fail a test, look at it. Check for hints and see how your code's output is different from the expected output. Have fun and if you need help, just ask!
